2. **Survey Section:**
   - Participants fill out personal information and questions about their social media video usage habits.
   - Questions include gender, age, occupation, residence, education level, and video content preferences.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - All responses are stored in a Google Sheet using an API.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Simple and intuitive UI for ease of use.

   - Built with React and Next.js for server-side rendering and easy deployment.
   - Ensure the application works on regular computer screen sizes.

2. **Backend:**
   - Simple Node.js server to handle API requests and interact with the Google Sheets API for data storage.

3. **Deployment:**
   - The application will be deployed on Vercel for easy access from multiple lab computers.
   - Ensure secure handling of API keys and data.
