## Introduction

This project is designed to conduct an experiment involving video and advertisement interactions. The experiment consists of participants watching videos and answering related questions, with some videos including advertisements. The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with data being stored in a Google Sheets document via an API.

## Features

- Video playback with embedded advertisements.
- Different interaction modes for ads (e.g., skippable after 5 seconds, choose to watch).
- Questionnaire with multiple-choice answers.
- Data storage in Google Sheets.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
